Jonathan Lipps Automation Guild 2019 Code Samples
===

This is the sample code that goes along with Jonathan Lipps's 2019 Automation Guild presentation (link TBD).

It is a full Gradle-based Java project. You should be able to import it and have it work as long as you know what you are doing with your IDE and gradle.

The only dependency which is not included is the Angry Birds APK, since I am not Rovio. You need to get an Angry Birds APK and put it at this location in the project:

```
src/test/java/resources/angrybirds.apk
```
